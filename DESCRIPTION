Description: Implements methods described by the paper Robins and Tsiatis (1991) <DOI:10.1080/03610929108830654>. These use g-estimation to estimate the causal effect of a treatment in a two-armed randomised control trial where non-compliance exists and is measured, under an assumption of an accelerated failure time model and no unmeasured confounders.
