Description: Implements methods described by the paper Robins \& Tsiatis, 1991, <http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03610929108830654>. These use g-estimation to estimate the causal effect of a treatment in a two-armed randomised control trial where non-compliance exists and is measured, under an assumption of an accelerated failure time model and no unmeasured confounders.
